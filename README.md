Best search for even and odd numbers. The code is optimized and runs at 3rd space speed and can even reach the speed of light and higher (even if your device does not give such possibilities, my development will optimize your machine automatically!). The complexity of the algorithm in terms of speed is O(1) and in terms of memory is O(1)!

I consider the main advantages of my design to be a combination of speed of operation, low entropy, and most importantly ***HIGH READABILITY***

There is a version with lighter calculations `odd_even.py` and heavier calculations `odd_even_big.py`
